//These are notes I usually jot down during coding sessions, so I remember to add updates to documentation later:

-  All designer-friendly resources are being quaratined to Resources > PlanetLoadInfo. Designers can be directed here if they want to modify planet values, textures, etc
-  The PlanetTextures asset in the PlanetLoadInfo folder updates automatically to match the Planets.csv asset in that folder. Direct designers to update the CSV first if they want to add new planets
